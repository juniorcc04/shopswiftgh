ShopSwift

A complete Flutter-based e-commerce application that integrates both User and Admin functionalities into a single project.

Project Overview

ShopSwift is a cross-platform mobile and web application built with Flutter. The app provides a seamless shopping experience for customers while also including an admin dashboard for product management. Unlike most e-commerce apps that separate the admin and user sides, ShopSwift combines both, making it easy to test, manage, and demonstrate within a single codebase.

The user side allows customers to browse products, view details, and manage their profiles. The admin side provides tools to add, update, categorize, and delete products in real time using Firebase Firestore. Images are hosted via external providers such as Cloudinary, ensuring fast loading and easy integration.

This project was built with scalability and responsiveness in mind, making it usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Product Browsing: Products are displayed in categories such as Electronics, Fashion, Home, Books, and Beauty.
